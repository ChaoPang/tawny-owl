* IRI Creation

Have a OBO style generator. 

Initially, generate an UUID style identifer for new terms. Can use memorise to
save and to store these in a file. Add a URI gen client which will search for
these, and replace them with newly minted URIs. Have to add a purl creation
client also, which will update all purls and make sure that they point to the
correct place. 


* Enhancements

** Clojure IDs as annotation

The identifiers used within clojure should be placed onto the ontology as
annotations. The idea here is that someone using clojure-owl to generate an
OWL file, should be able to read this OWL file in and recreate what they
started with (at least in terms of ids and so on). 


** Version ID

Support Version ID for everything.



* Bugs 

** transitive 

and other facets are all stored as strings which is dangerous.

Fixed, this by turning them into objects, but this fails also, for reasons I
don't quite understand yet.
