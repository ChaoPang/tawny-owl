* Multiple ontologies


Want something like

(defontology name iri expressivity file)

(defontology pizza "http://pizza.com" 
    :OWL-DL)

Maybe need to do this as a record or a hash or something. 

This will set the "default" ontology. Also define a macro

(with-ontology pizza

   (owl/owlclass "PizzaTopping")
   (owl/owlclass "PizzaBase")

)

For doing multiple ontologies, with multiple names spaces. Basically, just
set this ontology as a local and away you go.
