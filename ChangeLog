	* src/owl/render.clj: Start of a framework for pretty printing
	of OWL entities

2012-11-13  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/owl/owl.clj: Default ontology is now bound into the
	namespace. Modifiying ontologies in two namespaces now works as
	expected rather than adding which ever defontology was evaled
	last.

	* src/owl/owl.clj: Now handles prefixes for all the ontologies
	that have been loaded.
